```

### Running the experiments

1. To run the RFU and RFU-SS on MNIST
```
python /RFU-SS/VIBU_with_backdoor/On_MNIST/temp.py
```

2. To run the RFU and RFU-SS on CIFAR10
```
python /RFU-SS/VIBU_with_backdoor/On_CIFAR10/cifar10_test.py
```

3. To run our reproduced and improved HFU and VBU on MNIST
```
